<h3 class="sorted-element">2025 - bonelab mod manager <a href="https://github.com/aerits/bonelab-mod-manager">link</a></h3>
<p>This is a simple mod manager styled like the arch linux package manager kinda. Its a cli utility so you don't have to open bonelab to install mods.
    Its pretty simple.
</p>

<h3 class="sorted-element">2025 - vr rhythm game controllers</h3>
<p>I like arcade rhythm games, but the controllers are pretty expensive. I spent like 150 bucks for a controller to play one game.
    Honestly not money worth, but its a good controller. In theory VR could simulate the controllers, so I'm gonna make a bunch of vr controllers.
</p>
<h4>taiko controller <a href="https://github.com/aerits/taiko-vr-controller">github</a></h4>
<p>
    This is the first VR controller I've made so far. Its based off the drumming game Taiko No Tatsujin.
    This is a game that uses a traditional japanese style drum. Currently it inputs j if you hit the middle of the drum and k if you hit the rim.
    Future plans are to make the drum sticks have physics so you move once but hit the drum multiple times.
</p>
<p>
    Its written in Rust with the Bevy game engine. I chose this because I'm not sure if unity or godot let you create OpenXR overlays,
    which my project is an overlay, meaning that if you open another game in the background, you can see both. This is so that you can
     open a cool environment in vrchat while using the drum controller.
</p>
<p>
    An issue I've noticed is that there's no physical feedback in hitting the drum, which kinda sucks. Thats the nature of VR though.

<h3 class="sorted-element">2025 - PPTE</h3>
<p>This is a game that I've been working on for a while. It's a clone of puyo puyo tetris,
    but the idea is its a multiplayer web game like tetrio. Puyo puyo is a block stacking puzzle
    game that is similar to tetris, but there are no web versions of the game yet.
    I didn't use a game engine because I hate unity.
    You can play the latest deployed version <a href="https://erm.0000727.xyz">here</a> right now.
    Its written all in rust, and because of that, I also made a version of the client for 3ds.
    It uses MVC so making alternate clients is easy.
    For tetris, the plan is to implement all of modern tetris features, like 7 bag, srs, etc.
    The srs system is pretty complicated, and the way I implemented it only works for the 7 tetriminoes.
    I want to generalize the srs system to work for n-minoes later on to allow for pentamino and hexamino modes.

<p>This is in progress, because I'm currently working on making a sort of networking over audio for 3ds.
    Certain frequencies of audio would be different digits in hexadecimal, and the 3ds would read those through
    the microphone and use a fast fourier transform to decode frequencies from the audio wave.
    This would allow a really stupid way to do local multiplayer where the 3ds's make high pitched beeping
    noises.</p>

<h3 class="sorted-element">2025 - static site generator</h3>
<p>This is a work in progress, you can see the documentation at <a href="ssg-docs.html">this link</a>.
    The website you are on is being generated by this. I have some pretty hacky stuff in it to allow for python
    scripting from html.
</p>

<h3 class="sorted-element">2024 - Discord bot</h3>
<p>I created a voice-activated AI chatbot for Discord inspired by the VTuber "Neuro-sama" and its creator,
    Vedal, who mentioned using Discord for interactions. I decided to develop a similar bot that you can
    communicate with in a voice channel. This project enables real-time voice interactions with an AI directly
    within Discord.</p>

<h3 class="sorted-element">2023 - Shape Shooter</h3>
<p>This is a web-based multiplayer videogame inspired by the game diep.io. I created it with 3 other classmates
    in my AP CS class.</p>
