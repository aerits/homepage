mario kart world is so peak <br />
the tracks are some of the best in the series <br />
the tech is so good <br />
its weird how mechanically deep
rails are, hopping onto rails takes skill <br />
staying on rails is risky when its easy to get bumped off from someone drafting you <br />
airship fortress is practically a whole new track when you spend half of it on rails

ok im trying to make a pixel art -> voxel thing and it appears that you can't make a voxel model for every possible set of 6 images for the 6 viewing angles of a model <br />
maybe instead i'll just make a voxel editor that is easy to use <br />
i really want to make my own version of mario kart, im putting ppte on hiatus <br />
and i need a bunch of 3d models to make
 a mario kart, so thats why im making
 a voxel maker

i want to rewrite <b>diced-ssg</b> in rust<br>
theres no performance issues so far but i would like it to scale 
to a larger site easily<br>
you can still run python code in rust with pyo3<br>
so my hacky solution to writing python on html should still 
be doable<br>
