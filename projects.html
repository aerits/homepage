<p>These are my most cool programming projects. </p>

<h3>PPTE (2025)</h3>
<p>This is a game that I've been working on for a while. It's a clone of puyo puyo tetris,
    but the idea is its a multiplayer web game like tetrio. Puyo puyo is a block stacking puzzle
    game that is similar to tetris, but there are no web versions of the game yet.
    I didn't use a game engine because I hate unity.
    You can play the latest deployed version <a href="https://erm.0000727.xyz">here</a> right now.
    Its written all in rust, and because of that, I also made a version of the client for 3ds.
    It uses MVC so making alternate clients is easy.
    For tetris, the plan is to implement all of modern tetris features, like 7 bag, srs, etc.
    The srs system is pretty complicated, and the way I implemented it only works for the 7 tetriminoes.
    I want to generalize the srs system to work for n-minoes later on to allow for pentamino and hexamino modes.

<p>This is in progress, because I'm currently working on making a sort of networking over audio for 3ds.
    Certain frequencies of audio would be different digits in hexadecimal, and the 3ds would read those through
    the microphone and use a fast fourier transform to decode frequencies from the audio wave.
    This would allow a really stupid way to do local multiplayer where the 3ds's make high pitched beeping
    noises.</p>

<h3>Discord bot (2024)</h3>
<p>I created a voice-activated AI chatbot for Discord inspired by the VTuber "Neuro-sama" and its creator,
    Vedal, who mentioned using Discord for interactions. I decided to develop a similar bot that you can
    communicate with in a voice channel. This project enables real-time voice interactions with an AI directly
    within Discord.</p>

<h3>Shape Shooter (2023)</h3>
<p>This is a web-based multiplayer videogame inspired by the game diep.io. I created it with 3 other classmates
    in my AP CS class.</p>
