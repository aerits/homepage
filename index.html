            <p>This is my personal website. Why am I using a pseudonym? Cuz I like mangoes.</p>
            
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Huge fan of mangoes, rhythm games, and linux.</p>
            
            <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
            <p>These are my most cool programming projects. </p>
            <h3>Shape Shooter</h3>
            <p>This is a web-based multiplayer videogame inspired by the game diep.io. I created it with 3 other classmates in my AP CS class.</p>

            <h3>Discord bot</h3>
            <p>I created a voice-activated AI chatbot for Discord inspired by the VTuber "Neuro-sama" and its creator, Vedal, who mentioned using Discord for interactions. I decided to develop a similar bot that you can communicate with in a voice channel. This project enables real-time voice interactions with an AI directly within Discord.</p>

            "When you die, your body will decompose and be absorbed by the earth, but the atoms that made you up will continue to exist in the universe forever.",
