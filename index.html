<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>I have created a terrible static site generator to generate this dynamically. It looks for any files with 
    <code>.temp</code> in its name and then writes to new files with <code>.html</code>, inserting it between the 
text in <code>template.html</code></p>
<div class="code-head">file::generator.py:: python</div><pre><code>import os
import re
template_dir = "./templates/"
files: list[str] = os.listdir(template_dir)
temp_first: str = ""
temp_last: str = ""
with open(template_dir + "template.html", 'r') as file:
    toggle: bool = True
    for line in file:
        if toggle:
            temp_first += line
        else:
            temp_last += line
