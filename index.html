        <h1>Welcome to DicedMangoes's Dumping Grounds</h1>
        <p>This is my personal website. Why am I using a pseudonym? Cuz I like mangoes.</p>
        <p>I paid so much incredible money for this domain name 0000727.xyz so like i need a website.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Huge fan of mangoes, rhythm games, and linux.</p>

        <h2>Programming Projects</h2>
        <p>These are my most cool programming projects. </p>

        <h3>PPTE (2025)</h3>
        <p>This is a game that I've been working on for a while. It's a clone of puyo puyo tetris,
            but the idea is its a multiplayer web game like tetrio. Puyo puyo is a block stacking puzzle
            game that is similar to tetris, but there are no web versions of the game yet.
            You can play the latest deployed version <a href="https://erm.0000727.xyz">here</a> right now.
            Its written all in rust, and because of that, I also made a version of the client for 3ds.
            It uses MVC so making alternate clients is easy.
            For tetris, the plan is to implement all of modern tetris features, like 7 bag, srs, etc.
            The srs system is pretty complicated, and the way I implemented it only works for the 7 tetriminoes.
            I want to generalize the srs system to work for n-minoes later on to allow for pentamino and hexamino modes.
        </p>

            referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>This is in progress, because I'm currently working on making a sort of networking over audio for 3ds.
            Certain frequencies of audio would be different digits in hexadecimal, and the 3ds would read those through
            the microphone and use a fast fourier transform to decode frequencies from the audio wave.
            This would allow a really stupid way to do local multiplayer where the 3ds's make high pitched beeping
            noises.</p>

        <h3>Discord bot (2024)</h3>
        <p>I created a voice-activated AI chatbot for Discord inspired by the VTuber "Neuro-sama" and its creator,
            Vedal, who mentioned using Discord for interactions. I decided to develop a similar bot that you can
            communicate with in a voice channel. This project enables real-time voice interactions with an AI directly
            within Discord.</p>

        <h3>Shape Shooter (2023)</h3>
        <p>This is a web-based multiplayer videogame inspired by the game diep.io. I created it with 3 other classmates
            in my AP CS class.</p>
